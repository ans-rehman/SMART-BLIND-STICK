# Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired

## Introduction

The Smart Walking Stick is a project designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings independently. This innovative walking stick incorporates various sensors and technologies to detect obstacles in the user's path and provide real-time feedback to help them navigate safely.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: Utilizes sensors to detect obstacles or objects in front of the user and provides warnings in the form of voice feedback.
- **Position Monitoring**: Monitors the position of the user in real-time, enhancing navigation accuracy.
- **Automatic Room Equipment Switching**: Incorporates functionality to automatically switch room equipment, facilitating indoor navigation for the visually impaired.
- **Reduced Dependency**: Reduces the dependency of visually impaired individuals on others, promoting independence and mobility.
- **Low-Cost Solution**: Provides a cost-effective solution compared to existing assistive devices, making it accessible to a larger population.
